Completing workshop 7 improved my understanding of the standard template library STL. 

The STL contains manifold functions that operate on particular types; these functions are compatible with the algorithms library to produce solutions to common tasks. 

For instance, if the task is to count the number of even numbers in a vector, the function count_if would suffice instead of using manual iteration to traverse the vector and a selection statement to determine if the number at the index is even. 

Solving problems manually when the standard library already provides the solution usually results in errors. 

Namely, off by one errors, and it is best to allow the algorithms library to handle such things. 

Completing the workshop was a seamless task. However, learning how to implement the transform algorithm was arduous. 

Occasionally, the official documentation became very technical and resulted in a misunderstanding of the provided examples. 

The functions used to complete the workshop are: transform, sort, for_each, any_of, and copy_if. 

I utilized transform to remove the names of the crimes that contained the string none. 

The transform function suffices here since it can alter the contents of the information in place supplied to the function. 

Also, I utilized the sort algorithm to sort the crimes via province, crime, cases, and resolved. 

The sort function is adequate in this situation since it can reorder the contents in any way specified; since the sort algorithm exists, there is no need to traverse the vector of crimes manually and use selection to evaluate the member variable against the target string(option).

Moreover, I used the for_each algorithm to display each crime in the vector to calculate the total of cases resolved and the total number of cases. 

Previously, I used the accumulate algorithm twice to calculate the total number of crimes and the total number of resolved crimes. However, such a method is staggeringly inefficient because two additional iteration statements were added to the function thus increasing its execution time.

It is ideal to do all the calculations within the for_each since the same vector contains all the necessary information. 

The any_of algorithm determined if a crime with an offence matching the target string existed. 

Any_of is efficient since it traverses the container from beginning to end, returning true if there is an occurrence and stopping the iteration thereafter.

The copy_if algorithm copied all the contents from the original vector into a new vector where the province matched the target string. 

Copy_if is best suitable for such a situation because the original contents of the vector need to remain the same. 

I would convert the first character in the target string for the sort function to uppercase and each subsequent character to lowercase in the 
sort function so that the target string does not need to be case sensitive. 

Moreover, to impove the sort function, I would implement selection statements for each option, and call sort in each respective case. 

Implementing the selection statements within the for_each would require less code, 

however, the option would be evaluated constantly for each object in the vector. Therefore, this is redundant.  

To prevent the client from specifing an invalid string I would declare an assertion within the sort function

this way the compiler can determine if the string is invalid and stop the program. 



//NEW SORT FUNCTION 

void sort(const std::string& option) {
	const std::map<std::string, int, std::less<>> valid_options = {
	{"Province",1},{"Crime",2}, {"Cases",3}, {"Resolved",4} };

	//convert the first character of the target string to upper case
	auto opt = option;

	opt[0] = toupper(opt[0]);
	//// convert each character from index 1 to lower case

	std::for_each(opt.begin() + 1, opt.end(), [](auto& c) {
		c = tolower(c);
		});

	//check if the option exists in the map 
	auto found = valid_options.find(opt);

	// if the option does not exist 
		//error 
	assert(found != std::end(valid_options));

	//rest of sort function
	if (found->first == "Province") {
		std::sort(crimes.begin(), crimes.end(), [](const Crime& c_left, const Crime& c_right) {
			return c_left.province < c_right.province;
			});
	}

	else if (found->first == "Crime") {
		std::sort(crimes.begin(), crimes.end(), [](const Crime& c_left, const Crime& c_right) {
			return c_left.crime < c_right.crime;
			});
	}

	else if ((found->first) == "Cases") {
		std::sort(crimes.begin(), crimes.end(), [](const Crime& c_left, const Crime& c_right) {
			return c_left.number_of_cases < c_right.number_of_cases;
			});
	}

	else if (found->first == "Resolved") {
		std::sort(crimes.begin(), crimes.end(), [](const Crime& c_left, const Crime& c_right) {
			return c_left.m_resolved < c_right.m_resolved;
			});
	}
}
